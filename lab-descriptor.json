  "introduction": "The Inorganic Chemistry Virtual Lab is an immersive, simulation-based platform designed to enhance students’ understanding of fundamental and advanced concepts in inorganic chemistry through interactive experimentation. Bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, this virtual lab offers a safe, accessible, and resource-efficient environment to explore diverse chemical principles related to analytical chemistry, coordination chemistry, environmental chemistry, and solid-state chemistry.<br><br> With a particular focus on water and soil analysis, gravimetric estimation, acid-base titration, alloy analysis, and theoretical topics such as crystal field theory and group theory, this lab caters to both undergraduate and postgraduate learners in chemical sciences. It ensures conceptual reinforcement while promoting environmental awareness and analytical competence.",
